# 🧠 Engineering Challenges

Building AtmosLive involved more than displaying weather information. The project required balancing responsive UI, asynchronous networking, and reliable location services while maintaining a clean application architecture.

### 🌍 API Integration

Integrating the OpenWeather API required handling asynchronous network requests, parsing weather data, and presenting results in a user-friendly format while maintaining application responsiveness.

---

### 📍 Location Management

Supporting both automatic GPS detection and manual city search required careful coordination between Android location services and remote weather APIs.

---

### 🔄 Reactive UI

Weather information changes dynamically based on user location and API responses. StateFlow was used to keep the interface synchronized without requiring manual refresh logic.

---

### ⚡ Performance & Reliability

The application was designed to minimize unnecessary API calls while providing smooth animations, quick response times, and efficient state management.

---

# 📚 Key Learnings

AtmosLive strengthened my understanding of modern Android application development through practical implementation of networking, architecture, and reactive programming.

During development I gained experience in:

- Building REST API driven Android applications.
- Implementing MVVM with Repository Pattern.
- Managing asynchronous operations using Kotlin Coroutines.
- Creating reactive interfaces using StateFlow.
- Integrating Retrofit with external APIs.
- Working with Android location services.
- Designing responsive Jetpack Compose interfaces.
- Structuring maintainable Android projects.

The project reinforced the importance of clean architecture, separation of concerns, and user-focused interface design when building production-ready Android applications.
