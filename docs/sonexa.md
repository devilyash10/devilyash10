# 📖 Executive Summary

Sonexa is a modern Android music streaming application developed to explore production-ready Android engineering using the latest Jetpack libraries and architectural best practices.

The project combines **Jetpack Compose**, **Media3 ExoPlayer**, **MVVM**, **Kotlin Coroutines**, **StateFlow**, **Room Database**, and **Retrofit** to create a responsive, scalable, and maintainable media application that supports both local playback and online streaming.

Rather than focusing only on audio playback, Sonexa emphasizes software architecture, reactive UI development, asynchronous programming, and user experience—making it a practical demonstration of building medium-scale Android applications with modern development practices.

---

# 🎯 Why Sonexa?

Most Android music player projects demonstrate only basic playback functionality. Sonexa was built to explore the engineering challenges involved in creating a production-oriented media application using modern Android technologies.

The project focuses on building a responsive, scalable, and maintainable music streaming experience while applying current Android development practices throughout the entire application lifecycle.

Instead of treating playback as an isolated feature, Sonexa integrates networking, local persistence, reactive state management, and media services into a unified architecture designed for long-term scalability.

# 🏗 Architecture Overview

Sonexa is designed around **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** and **Clean Architecture**, providing a clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data sources.

Instead of tightly coupling playback logic with UI components, each layer has a well-defined responsibility, making the application easier to maintain, test, and extend as new features are introduced.

The application follows a reactive programming model powered by **StateFlow** and **Kotlin Coroutines**, allowing playback state, playlists, search results, and UI updates to remain synchronized without manual refresh logic.

# 🧠 Engineering Challenges

Developing Sonexa involved solving several practical Android engineering challenges beyond implementing media playback.

### 🎼 Media Engine Integration

Synchronizing **Media3 ExoPlayer** with a fully declarative **Jetpack Compose** interface required careful lifecycle management to ensure playback remained stable during configuration changes.

---

### 🔄 Reactive State Management

Playback controls, queues, equalizer settings, playlists, and search results all update through a reactive **StateFlow** architecture, eliminating manual UI synchronization.

---
